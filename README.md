# About the Author

I’m an Australian from an Indian background so my culture is a blend between both Australian and Indian. I have lived in this country for 10+ years and completed majority of my high school education in Melbourne. I also did Bachelor in Science (Electrical Systems) at University of Melbourne but unfortunately due to work commitments I had to drop the course in my final semester. After my course, I join the Australian Defence Force and I have been working in the Army for almost 2 years now.
Coming from a Indian background my family and I are very adaptable, our culture brings a vibrance to our lives and people around us by the flashy Bollywood movies, music, and our food which also brings families together. So overall, my Indian culture brings the adaptable, interesting and caring side of my character whereas the Australian culture that I have been accustomed to in the recent years brings out the mateship, confidence and independent individual I have become.
In my spare time, I like to explore vast variety of things such as scuba diving, playing sports such as soccer, badminton and swimming. I am also very fond of riding motorcycles which has become the latest of my favourite past times after I got my licence recently. Summer months really allows me to do all the things I love and since I live only a couple of hours away from the most fun city in Australia, Gold Coast, there’s  not much that stops me from indulge in a bit of leisure. Unfortunately, I never had a pet growing up because of all the hassles involved in moving from India to a completely new place like Australia and the constant change of houses, my family thought it was best not to force another living being through the struggle. But I would love to get a pet, most likely a dog, in the near future.

# Interest in IT
My interest in Information Technology began when I was doing my first bachelors which involved some coding as fundamentals for Electrical Engineering. Initially IT was forced on to me although I disliked it very much purely because coming from an Indian social circle, many of my mates and my family friends were in IT field and I really didn’t like what they did for a living. But soon I came to realise that IT is everywhere and its everything. It’s innovation, its creation and its history. Let me explain… IT allows you to make progress in leaps and bounds relative to anything we have seen in the past, creating things we only dreamt of in the past – MRI machines, Virtual reality, smart home systems like in Iron Man movies. This is a direct result of the things we have learn through out history which is leading our drive towards innovation and the freedom we have allows us to create whatever our heart desires. This brought out a whole new perspective in me – to be in the leading edge of innovation, if not at least be up to date with the latest trends and technology – move forward with the world. My experiences with IT are adequate – I have done courses in C, Java and I have self-taught VBA and python. I have also used Verilog which is a hardware description language used in my previous degree.
Honestly, I chose RMIT because I knew mates who went to RMIT when I was studying in University of Melbourne and highly recommended it. Moreover, RMIT being one of the few universities that offer IT and knowing its reputation, made it an easy decision when I was looking for a course through Open Universities Australia.
I expect to become proficient at a few more coding languages, build on my existing skills. I would like to gain an appreciation for new technologies in this ever-changing field. Finally, I would like to have a degree in IT that would help me advance in my current workplace or shift my experience and knowledge to the private sector in order to progress my career.

## Description:
The position of the Senior Cyber Security Manger is to leader a team of cyber security specialists at EY. The role from my understanding requires prior experience in both leadership and management but also technical expertise in cyber security. The job advertised lists the things that is required in the applicant which’ll allow the m to be successful in this role, lists the risk management framework they must be competent in and finally lists the extra attributes they must possess such as good communication and interpersonal skills which is vital for a senior position. Moreover, this position requires you to have a intimate understanding of the job as well as be able to lead junior members through their roles – mentoring and managing their needs. This can be challenging and rewarding at the same time hence the job appeals to me because when I progress through my career, I’d like to continue doing my job that I started off with, continue doing the role I felt passionate about while using my experience and knowledge to coach newer members of the team and guide them towards the gaols of the company that I’d come to understand through my experiences.
